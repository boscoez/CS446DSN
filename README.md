# CS446DSN DEPLOY

This a group project for CS course @CWU. Team members for this project are Long Le, Garrett Brower, and Boscoe Lindholm. 
This project began as a 'paper prototype' and has meta-morphed into the iGuide Travel Template concept. Representing our 
team I created this repository and added the files. This will be my first deployment and I am happy and excited to do this 
on behalf of our team.
